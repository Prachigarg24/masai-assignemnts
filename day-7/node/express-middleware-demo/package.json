Express.js is a lightweight web framework built on top of Node.js that simplifies building web servers and APIs. Why Express over Node.js? Simplifies routing Built-in middleware support Cleaner request/response handling Faster development Widely used & production-tested Node.js gives low-level APIs, Express provides abstraction and structure. 2. What is middleware in Express? Explain middleware chain. Middleware is a function that has access to req, res, and next(). Middleware chain flow: Request → Middleware 1 → Middleware 2 → Route → Response Each middleware decides whether to: Modify request/response Pass control using next() End the request 3. Types of Middleware in Express Application-level app.use(middleware) Router-level router.use(middleware) Error-handling app.use((err, req, res, next) => {}) Built-in express.json() express.static() Third-party morgan cors 4. How does error handling work in Express? Errors are passed using next(error) Error middleware has 4 parameters (err, req, res, next) Express automatically skips normal middleware and jumps to error middleware. 5. Difference between app.use() and app.all() app.use()\tapp.all() Works for all HTTP methods\tMatches all HTTP methods Used for middleware\tUsed for routes Path optional\tPath required 6. Routing in Express & Route Parameters Routing maps HTTP requests to handlers. app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {   res.send(req.params.id); }); req.params captures dynamic values from URL. 7. Route Handlers vs Middleware Route Handler\tMiddleware Ends request\tPre-process request Sends response\tCalls next() Specific route\tReusable 8. How do you handle file uploads in Express? Using multer const multer = require('multer'); const upload = multer({ dest: 'uploads/' });",
